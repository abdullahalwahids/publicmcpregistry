# [Public MCP Registry](https://publicmcpregistry.com/): Product Pitch

## Headline
**The Missing App Store for AI Agents & LLMs**

## The Problem
The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is revolutionizing how AI models interact with the real world, but the ecosystem is currently fragmented.
- **Discovery is broken:** Useful servers are buried in obscure GitHub repos.
- **Trust is low:** Running unknown code on your machine is risky.
- **Setup is hard:** Configuration differs for every tool and client.

## The Solution: [Public MCP Registry](https://publicmcpregistry.com/)
We are building the definitive, community-driven hub for the MCP ecosystem—a place where developers can publish their tools and users can safely discover them.

## Key Value Props

### 1. Discovery Engine
We don't just list repos; we categorize them by *capability*.
*   *Need to access a database?*
*   *Need browser automation?*
*   *Need to integrate with [Linear](https://linear.app)/[Slack](https://slack.com)/[Stripe](https://stripe.com)?*
Our directory makes finding the right tool instant, replacing hours of searching Twitter/Discord.

### 2. The "Verified" Trust Layer
We solve the security anxiety of running 3rd-party code.
- **Official Badges:** Clearly identify integrations maintained by the service providers themselves.
- **Community Verification:** Highlight top-tier community projects that are vetted and safe.
- **Signals:** We aggregate GitHub stars, open issues, and activity to show project health at a glance.

### 3. Frictionless Adoption
We turn complex READMEs into one-click-style config snippets.
- **Standardized Guides:** Whether you use [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) or [Cursor](https://cursor.com), we provide the exact JSON config you need.
- **Demo Videos:** See exactly what the tool does before you install it.

## Why Now?
As AI moves from "chatting" to "acting", the layer that connects models to tools (MCP) will become as critical as the models themselves. [Public MCP Registry](https://publicmcpregistry.com/) is positioning itself to be the primary gateway for this new economy of AI tools.
